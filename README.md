# DataAnalytics_GRIP-Task2 and Task3

# Task 2:
To Explore Supervised Machine Learning: In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

# Task 3:
To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
